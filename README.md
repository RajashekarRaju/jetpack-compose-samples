# Jetpack Compose Samples

## :scroll: Description

This repository contains samples on jetpack compose for building different components like layouts,
animations, transitions, saving states and more.

`Jetpack Compose` is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI. It enables you to quickly
bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

App navigation is built with `Compose` too which eliminates the previous way of using `Navigation`
Component with `xml` graph. This made development faster also passing args, changing destinations
and no need to rebuild.

Understanding to implement own `Theme` `Shape` `Typography` `Color` has became bit easier by
referring to lot of official jetpack compose samples which are available in GitHub.

Best of all we got to do this in `Kotlin` way. Excited and long way to go from here.
